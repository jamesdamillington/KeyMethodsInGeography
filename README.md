Model code can be run in NetLogo, available from http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ These model files are for the model mentioned in the book chapter text:
- Model 1: SimRed_Model1.nlogo
- Model 2: SimRed_Model2.nlogo
- Model 3: SimRed_Model3.nlogo
- Model 4: SimRed_Model4.nlogo

Download all model files by clicking the green code button above, then Download ZIP.

See the suggested exercises below for ideas on how to explore them. Alongside these exercises you should also explore [the tutorials that are available for NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/)

## Exercises

### Model 1
- See how patterns vary for different establishment rules and random number generator seeds (i.e., different values of rand-seed).

### Model 2
- Vary values of rainfall-rate and plant-water-req to examine the influence on number and patterns of plants that grow and spread.
- Vary the establishment option to see how this influences patterns of vegetation. For which option do you see fewer (but larger) clusters of vegetation?
- Use the rand-seed slider to enable consistent comparisons.

### Model 3
- Examine combinations of p-dep, wind-strength and initial-depth to see how different forms (spatial patterns of heights of sand) vary over time (>50,000 ticks).
- Also, examine how patterns differ for different wind-direction.

### Model 4
- Try changing the log-alpha value (producing different values for alpha, the memory parameter) to change the TSF Curve and the ignition-rate value to change the number of ignitions per timestep.
- Look at how these changes influence the size of fires and how restricted they are by patterns of vegetation.
